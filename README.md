# CentralCanadaShrubification_1984to2016

This repository contains code used in my [MSc thesis](https://qspace.library.queensu.ca/items/69f388fa-3253-47ab-be6f-a362d9487c51) (2017) and subsequent [_Remote Sensing of Environment_ paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425718303675?via%3Dihub) (2018). The title of both are _Landscape variability of vegetation change across the forest to tundra transition of central Canada_.

Data are located [on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/12788412).
