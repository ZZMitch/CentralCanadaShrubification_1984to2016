This repository contains code used in my ([MSc thesis](https://qspace.library.queensu.ca/items/69f388fa-3253-47ab-be6f-a362d9487c51)) and subsequent ([_Remote Sensing of Environment_ paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425718303675?via%3Dihub)). The title of both are _Landscape variability of vegetation change across the forest to tundra transition of central Canada_.
